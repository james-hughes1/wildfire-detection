# wildfire-detection

This project explores how convolutional neural networks can be implemented to solve computer vision problems. In particular, here we apply CNNs to a classification problem involving images of wildfires from Kaggle.

The repository consists of the Jupyter notebook alongside some example images to feed to the final model. Running the notebook in Google Colaboratory is recommended so that you can find your own images to experiment with.
